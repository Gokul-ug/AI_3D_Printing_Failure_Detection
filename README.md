# 🧠🖨️ AI-Based 3D Printing Failure Detection

This repository contains my **Summer Internship Project (2025)** completed at the  
**Centre of Excellence in Additive Manufacturing**.

As a student, this project helped me explore how **deep learning, computer vision, and explainable AI** can be used to automatically detect **failures in FDM 3D printing** using images of printed parts.
